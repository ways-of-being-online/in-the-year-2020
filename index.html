    <h1>in the year twenty twenty</h1>

    <p>sharing, responding, meditating on, taking action based upon, moving forward with information</p>

    <h2>
      on being online
    </h2>

    <p>In Network Sovereignty, communications scholar Marisa Elena Duarte (Yaqui) writes, "Read against the century of US anti-Indian campaigms and imperial expansion, narratives of technological advancement function to satisfy societal desires of Englightenment-era values of progress and scientific evolution in spite of the colonial fabric of Indian eradication"<a href="#1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

    <p>protecting your own information online IS protecting your friends offline</p>

    <h2>
      on making technical tools
    </h2>

    <p>maps as always and already not protecting, and not only not protecting, but violently exposing, the people excluded in their making</p>
    
    <p><img src="duarte.png" /><a href="#2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

    <p>at the end of the day what is the technical tool that you made? <span>for example, at the end of the day he who shall not be named made a CRUD (create, read, update, delete) web app which allows people create profiles, make posts with text and images on a chronological timeline, and follow their friends who have done the same.</span> still at the end of the day the questions remain: in what ways have you ignored, forgotten, pushed aside, or perhaps even deliberately coded in the social position from which you are operating?</p>
